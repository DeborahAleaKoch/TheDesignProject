          <p>
            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
            could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
            to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
            paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some
            challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I
            saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
            interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the
            result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

          <div class="grid-box-child-size">
            <h4>Start with asking why</h4>
            <p>
              You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
              effective ways of achieving goals.

          <div class="grid-box-child-size">
            <h4>Your ideas will have more value</h4>
            <p>
              By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas
              will be fresher and more valuable.

          <div class="grid-box-child-size">
            <h4>Design solutions with love</h4>
            <p>
              Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
              frustration of the users and resolve to end it.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="grid-box-child-size">
            <h4>Share and show your work</h4>
            <p>
              As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
              finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept
              feedback and learn from it.

          <p>
            The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to
            create a solution to any problem you yourself are facing and show
            the result to the community.

              It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected
              you, like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering
              something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close
              attention to your surroundings.
