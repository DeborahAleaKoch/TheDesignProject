            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
            could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
            to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
            paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some
            challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I
            saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
            interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the
            result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.
